How to create a Slider app package for Apache Kafka

Create a zip package at the root of the package (<slider enlistment>/kafka/)
  zip -r kafka-1.0.0.zip .

Verify the content using  
  unzip -l "$@" kafka-1.0.0.zip

appConfig-default.json and resources-default.json are not required to be packaged.
These files are included as reference configuration for Slider apps and are suitable
for a one-node cluster.
